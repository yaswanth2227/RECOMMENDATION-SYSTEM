**The primary goal of this task is to implement a simple yet effective recommendation system using matrix factorization via collaborative filtering.

Recommendation systems are essential in modern data-driven platforms, where personalization is key to user engagement.

Examples include product suggestions on Amazon, movie recommendations on Netflix, and music curation on Spotify.

In this task, we create a system that predicts missing ratings from a given user-item rating matrix, all without relying on external libraries like NumPy or pandas.

Problem Overview: You are given a user-item matrix where rows represent users and columns represent items (such as movies, books, or products).

The values in the matrix are ratings that users have given to items, with a 0 indicating that the user has not rated that item.

The challenge is to predict these missing ratings to recommend items that the user might like but hasn’t interacted with yet.

Item features matrix (V): captures latent features of items (e.g., genre, popularity).

The core idea is that the dot product of a user’s feature vector and an item’s feature vector approximates the expected rating.

The system learns these vectors such that the predicted ratings are as close as possible to the actual known ratings.

Implementation Details: Initialization: Both user and item feature matrices are initialized with small values (e.g., 0.1). We choose k = 2 as the number of latent features, so each user and item is represented by a 2-dimensional vector.

Training (Gradient Descent): We use Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to train the system. For each non-zero rating in the matrix:

We compute the predicted rating as the dot product of the corresponding user and item vectors.

The error is calculated as the difference between the actual and predicted ratings.

We update both the user and item vectors using the error, a learning rate (0.01), and a regularization term (0.02) to prevent overfitting.

This process is repeated for a number of epochs (5000), gradually improving the prediction accuracy.

Prediction: After training, we use the final user and item feature matrices to predict the missing values in the matrix.

These predictions represent how likely a user is to enjoy an item they haven’t rated yet.

Output: The final output is a new matrix where all missing ratings are filled with predicted values, while existing ratings are preserved.

This allows for making item recommendations by identifying the highest predicted ratings for each user.

Benefits of the Approach: No External Libraries: This implementation is purely Python-based, ideal for educational settings or constrained environments.

Interpretable: Because of its simplicity, it provides a clear understanding of how recommendation systems work.

Efficient on Small Data: For small datasets, this model runs quickly and performs reasonably well.

Use Cases: This type of recommendation engine can be used in:

Movie or Book Recommenders

E-commerce platforms

Online learning systems

Music and content streaming apps

This task demonstrates how powerful machine learning concepts like matrix factorization can be implemented with basic tools,

providing a stepping stone to more advanced systems using libraries like scikit-learn, Surprise, or TensorFlow.
